# Loonfund-
Loonfund is a peer-to-peer fundraising platform dedicated exclusively to charitable giving. Loonfund uses a decentralized, crowdfunding model that allows users to send payments online without the interference of any 3rd parties. Traditional fundraising services and crowdfunding platforms collect some sort of transaction charge. Kickstarter, for example, charges a 5% transaction fee plus an additional 3-5% for payment processing. GoFundMe's fee is 5% from each donation you receive plus a payment processor fee of 2.9% + $0.30 per donation.
Loonfund is an open source, non profit aimed at providing the seamless transfer of money to needing individuals and causes. There are 0 transaction fees and the funds are transferrered directly to the cause. 
The user can create a fundraiser for either a charity or an individual cause:
1) If they opt for a charity, they can create a campaign to raise funds for a registered 501c3 non profit. For this option, the funds are   transferred directly to the charity organization.
  All funds raised from Certified Charity campaigns are sent directly to the charity and donors receive tax deductible receipts for their   donations.
2) If they opt for an individual cause, they can raise money for a private cause. This could include medical bills, a friendâ€™s tuition, a group volunteer trip or any personal cause acceptable on GoFundMe. For this option, the funds are transferred directly to the party organizing the fundraiser.  


Loonfund uses bootstraps framework and an Ethereum compatible JavaScript API "Web3," that allows us to communicate with the blockchain.
